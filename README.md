#
In Instance 1, I used the Simulated Annealing algorithm, but my result was not ideal, and the costs were the same.I think I made some silly mistakes.This algorithm requires setting the temperature and cooling rate, making parameter more complex.
#
Instance 2 used the simple hill climbing algorithm.It's quick and 'simple',I think it suitable for small scape question/ 
#
And Instance 3 used RMHC.
#
Instances 4, 5, and 6 used RMHC, RMHC with Strong Tweak, and Steepest Step and Restart, respectively.
#
RMHC truely increased chance to avoid local optima solution by multiple restarts.

#
I finished those instances by myself,and thanks to professor's recording vedio and some online resources those I forgot saving their link.But I deeply realised I didn't understand or master the algorithmï¼Œit's essential to continue learning and making some progress.
