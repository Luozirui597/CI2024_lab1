In Instance 1, I used the Simulated Annealing algorithm, but my result was not ideal, and the costs were the same.I think I made some silly mistakes. 
Instance 2 used the simple hill climbing algorithm.
And Instance 3 used RMHC.
Instances 4, 5, and 6 used RMHC, RMHC with Strong Tweak, and Steepest Step and Restart, respectively.
